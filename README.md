**Additional Notes:**

- ZoneTree has been tested successfully with up to **1 billion records** on standard desktop computers, demonstrating stability and efficiency even with very large datasets.

### Write-Ahead Log (WAL) Modes

ZoneTree offers **four WAL modes** to provide flexibility between performance and durability:

1. **Sync Mode**:

   - **Durability**: Maximum.
   - **Performance**: Slower write speed.
   - **Use Case**: Ensures data is not lost in case of crashes or power cuts.

2. **Sync-Compressed Mode**:

   - **Durability**: High, but slightly less than sync mode.
   - **Performance**: Faster write speed due to compression.
   - **Use Case**: Balances durability and performance; periodic jobs can persist decompressed tail records for added safety.

3. **Async-Compressed Mode**:

   - **Durability**: Moderate.
   - **Performance**: Very fast write speed; logs are written in a separate thread.
   - **Use Case**: Suitable where immediate durability is less critical but performance is paramount.

4. **None Mode**:
   - **Durability**: No immediate durability; relies on manual or automatic disk saves.
   - **Performance**: Maximum possible.
   - **Use Case**: Ideal for scenarios where performance is critical and data can be reconstructed or is not mission-critical.

## Getting Started

ZoneTree is designed for ease of use, allowing developers to integrate and utilize its capabilities with minimal setup.

### Basic Usage

```csharp
using Tenray.ZoneTree;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .OpenOrCreate();

zoneTree.Upsert(39, "Hello ZoneTree");
```

### Creating a Database

```csharp
using Tenray.ZoneTree;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Comparers;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Serializers;

var dataPath = "data/mydatabase";

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .SetComparer(new Int32ComparerAscending())
    .SetDataDirectory(dataPath)
    .SetKeySerializer(new Int32Serializer())
    .SetValueSerializer(new Utf8StringSerializer())
    .OpenOrCreate();

// Atomic (thread-safe) operation on single mutable-segment.
zoneTree.Upsert(39, "Hello ZoneTree!");

// Atomic operation across all segments.
zoneTree.TryAtomicAddOrUpdate(39, "a", (ref string x) =>
{
    x += "b";
    return true;
}, out var opIndex);
```

---

## Maintaining the LSM Tree

Large-scale LSM Trees require periodic maintenance to ensure optimal performance and resource utilization. ZoneTree provides the `IZoneTreeMaintenance` interface to facilitate comprehensive maintenance tasks.

**Example Usage:**

```csharp
using Tenray.ZoneTree;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Maintenance;

var dataPath = "data/mydatabase";

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, string>()
    .SetComparer(new Int32ComparerAscending())
    .SetDataDirectory(dataPath)
    .SetKeySerializer(new Int32Serializer())
    .SetValueSerializer(new Utf8StringSerializer())
    .OpenOrCreate();

using var maintainer = zoneTree.CreateMaintainer();
maintainer.EnableJobForCleaningInactiveCaches = true;

// Perform read/write operations.
zoneTree.Upsert(39, "Hello ZoneTree!");

// Wait for background maintenance tasks to complete.
maintainer.WaitForBackgroundThreads();
```

**Note:** For smaller datasets, maintenance tasks may not be necessary. The default maintainer allows developers to focus on core business logic without delving into LSM tree intricacies.

---

## Handling Deletions

In **Log-Structured Merge (LSM) trees**, deletions are managed by upserting a key/value pair with a **deletion marker**. Actual data removal occurs during the **compaction** stage.

By default, ZoneTree assumes that **default values** indicate deletion. This behavior can be customized by defining specific deletion flags or disabling deletions entirely using the `DisableDeletion` method.

### Using an Integer Deletion Flag

In this example, `-1` is used as the deletion marker for integer values:

```csharp
using Tenray.ZoneTree;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, int>()
    .SetIsDeletedDelegate((in int key, in int value) => value == -1)
    .SetMarkValueDeletedDelegate((ref int value) => value = -1)
    .OpenOrCreate();

// Deleting a key by setting its value to -1
zoneTree.Upsert(42, -1);
```

### Using a Custom Struct for Deletion

For more control, define a custom structure to represent values and their deletion status:

```csharp
using System.Runtime.InteropServices;
using Tenray.ZoneTree;

[StructLayout(LayoutKind.Sequential)]
struct MyDeletableValueType
{
    public int Number;
    public bool IsDeleted;
}

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, MyDeletableValueType>()
    .SetIsDeletedDelegate((in int key, in MyDeletableValueType value) => value.IsDeleted)
    .SetMarkValueDeletedDelegate((ref MyDeletableValueType value) => value.IsDeleted = true)
    .OpenOrCreate();

// Deleting a key by setting the IsDeleted flag
zoneTree.Upsert(42, new MyDeletableValueType { Number = 0, IsDeleted = true });
```

---

## Data Iteration

ZoneTree provides efficient mechanisms to iterate over data both **forward** and **backward**, with equal performance in both directions. Iterators also support **seek** operations for quick access to specific keys.

### Forward and Backward Iteration

```csharp
using Tenray.ZoneTree;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Collections;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, int>()
    .OpenOrCreate();

// Forward iteration
using var iterator = zoneTree.CreateIterator();
while (iterator.Next())
{
    var key = iterator.CurrentKey;
    var value = iterator.CurrentValue;
    // Process key and value
}

// Backward iteration
using var reverseIterator = zoneTree.CreateReverseIterator();
while (reverseIterator.Next())
{
    var key = reverseIterator.CurrentKey;
    var value = reverseIterator.CurrentValue;
    // Process key and value
}
```

### Seekable Iterator

The `ZoneTreeIterator` supports the `Seek()` method to jump to any record with **O(log(n))** complexity, useful for prefix searches and range queries.

```csharp
using Tenray.ZoneTree;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Collections;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<string, int>()
    .OpenOrCreate();

using var iterator = zoneTree.CreateIterator();

// Jump to the first record starting with "SomePrefix"
if (iterator.Seek("SomePrefix"))
{
    do
    {
        var key = iterator.CurrentKey;
        var value = iterator.CurrentValue;
        // Process key and value
    }
    while (iterator.Next());
}
```

---

## Transaction Support

ZoneTree supports **Optimistic Transactions**, ensuring **ACID compliance** while offering flexibility through various transaction models:

1. **Fluent Transactions**: Provides an intuitive, chainable API with built-in retry capabilities.
2. **Classical Transactions**: Traditional approach with explicit control over transaction lifecycle.
3. **Exceptionless Transactions**: Allows transaction management without relying on exceptions for control flow.

### Fluent Transactions

```csharp
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Tenray.ZoneTree;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Transaction;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, int>()
    .OpenOrCreateTransactional();

using var transaction = zoneTree
    .BeginFluentTransaction()
    .Do(tx => zoneTree.UpsertNoThrow(tx, 3, 9))
    .Do(tx =>
    {
        if (zoneTree.TryGetNoThrow(tx, 3, out var value).IsAborted)
            return TransactionResult.Aborted();

        if (zoneTree.UpsertNoThrow(tx, 3, 21).IsAborted)
            return TransactionResult.Aborted();

        return TransactionResult.Success();
    })
    .SetRetryCountForPendingTransactions(100)
    .SetRetryCountForAbortedTransactions(10);

await transaction.CommitAsync();
```

### Classical Transactions

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading;
using Tenray.ZoneTree;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Transaction;

using var zoneTree = new ZoneTreeFactory<int, int>()
    .OpenOrCreateTransactional();

try
{
    var txId = zoneTree.BeginTransaction();

    zoneTree.TryGet(txId, 3, out var value);
    zoneTree.Upsert(txId, 3, 9);

    var result = zoneTree.Prepare(txId);
    while (result.IsPendingTransactions)
    {
        Thread.Sleep(100);
        result = zoneTree.Prepare(txId);
    }

    zoneTree.Commit(txId);
}
catch (TransactionAbortedException)
{
    // Handle aborted transaction (retry or cancel)
}
```

### Exceptionless Transactions

```csharp
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Tenray.ZoneTree.Transactional;

public async Task<bool> ExecuteTransactionWithRetryAsync(ZoneTreeFactory<int, int> zoneTreeFactory, int maxRetries = 3)
{
    using var zoneTree = zoneTreeFactory.OpenOrCreateTransactional();
    var transactionId = zoneTree.BeginTransaction();

    // Execute the operations within the transaction
    var result = zoneTree.UpsertNoThrow(transactionId, 1, 100);
    if (result.IsAborted)
        return false; // Abort the transaction and return false on failure.

    result = zoneTree.UpsertNoThrow(transactionId, 2, 200);
    if (result.IsAborted)
        return false; // Abort the transaction and return false on failure.

    // Retry only the prepare step
    int retryCount = 0;
    while (retryCount <= maxRetries)
    {
        var prepareResult = zoneTree.PrepareNoThrow(transactionId);
        if (prepareResult.IsAborted)
            return false; // Abort the transaction and return false on failure.

        if (prepareResult.IsPendingTransactions)
        {
            await Task.Delay(100); // Simple delay before retrying
            retryCount++;
            continue; // Retry the prepare step
        }

        if (prepareResult.IsReadyToCommit)
            break; // Exit loop if ready to commit
    }

    // After successfully preparing, commit the transaction
    var commitResult = zoneTree.CommitNoThrow(transactionId);
    if (commitResult.IsAborted)
        return false; // Abort the transaction and return false on failure.

    // Transaction committed successfully
    return true;
}
```
